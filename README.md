### Tests structure
In the collection you can find two folders with the requests for "get top rated movies" and "rate a movie". 
There are some variables which are set up for the collection and shared between all the requests. 


The tests can be found in "Tests" tab for each request.

The tests with `POST` requests to "Rate movies on TMDB" have some Pre-request Scripts which are run before the request is sent and help to get `guest_session_id`.
